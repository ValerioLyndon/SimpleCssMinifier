I created this because most other minifiers I used modify the code in ways that break features or change the selector priority, which I don't want!

This is meant to be an uncomplicated minifier that has the main goal of removing all whitespace and comments with no changes to the codes functionality.

BE WARNED that this project has known issues and is not yet battle-tested. It needs a lot of work still! Use at your own risk and always test the resultant CSS to be sure it still works.
